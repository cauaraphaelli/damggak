Welcome to the repository of our browser-based game platform! In this integrative project (PI), we have developed a platform where users can create their accounts and enjoy a variety of original games. We utilized a range of technologies, including JavaScript, CSS, SCSS, EJS, TypeScript, and HTML. This repository contains all the source code, resources, and documentation related to our game platform.

<span style="font-size:30px;">Overview</span>
Our game platform was created as part of an integrative project carried out in college. Our aim was to provide users with a fun and engaging experience, where they can access a variety of original games without the need for additional installations. Additionally, we enable users to create accounts to track their progress and interact with other players.

<span style="font-size:30px;">Technologies Used</span>
JavaScript: We used JavaScript as the primary programming language to develop the game logic and interactivity.
CSS and SCSS: We employed CSS and SCSS to style the appearance of the games and ensure a pleasant visual experience.
EJS: We utilized EJS as our templating engine to dynamically generate HTML pages.
TypeScript: We leveraged TypeScript to add static typing and enhance the scalability and maintainability of the code.
HTML: We used HTML to structure the content and create the pages of the game platform.
