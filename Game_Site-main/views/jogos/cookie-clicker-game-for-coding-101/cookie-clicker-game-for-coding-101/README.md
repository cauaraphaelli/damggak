# Cookie Clicker Game for Coding 101

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/marisdu/pen/ZJKzRG](https://codepen.io/marisdu/pen/ZJKzRG).

I created this simple version of a popular JS game called Cookie Clicker (http://orteil.dashnet.org/cookieclicker/) in order to teach my Coding 101 students about basic HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The students were aged 9-13 and had a blast customizing this code to make it their style.
